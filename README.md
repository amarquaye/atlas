## Introduction

Atlas is a hallucination detector for Large Language Models.
Its main focus is on **generative text** as that is the most widely used medium for interacting with LLMs.

### Why work on hallucination in LLMs?

Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing human-computer interaction, generating increasingly _fluent_ and
_human-like text_.
However, a significant challenge in LLMs is their tendency to produce **hallucinations**, or factually incorrect,
nonsensical, or misleading content.
As humans become increasingly reliant on LLMs for information and decision-making, ensuring their reliability and
accuracy is crucial.
This project aims to address this challenge by developing a software for **detecting** and **mitigating**
hallucinations in LLMs so users can rely on LLM outputs with greater confidence, leading to wider adoption and
societal benefits and also reduces the risk of misinformation to promote responsible use of LLMs.

### Why Atlas?

The story of Atlas in Greek mythology is closely tied to his role in supporting the heavens. According to one myth,
during the _Titanomachy; the war between the Titans and the Olympian gods_, Atlas sided with the Titans. After their
defeat, Zeus condemned Atlas to bear the weight of the heavens on his shoulders for eternity.

The name **Atlas** symbolizes the software's commitment to bearing the responsibility of overseeing the cognitive
aspects of language models, maintaining their stability, and preventing them from collapsing into inaccuracies or
hallucinations. The association with Atlas also conveys _strength_, _resilience_, and _reliability_, suggesting a
software that can handle the weight of complex language processing tasks with steadfastness and precision.

### Aims or Objectives

- [x] Explore techniques for mitigating hallucinations in LLMs.
- [x] Develop a software for automatic detection of hallucinations in LLMs.
- [x] Evaluate the effectiveness of the developed tool in different LLMs.

## Methodology

Our approach will be the design and implementation of a software to detect or flag and mitigate
hallucinations in LLMs.
The ultimate objective is the creation of a ~~browser extension~~ or [website](https://atlasproject-phi.vercel.app "View site") to
actively scan the output from LLMs and
compare them with results from trusted sources on the web and inform the user of any occurrence of hallucinations.

### What we plan to do

- Detect and mitigate hallucinations in the form of generated text.

### What we do not plan to do

- ~~Detecting and mitigating hallucination in images generated by LLMs.~~
- ~~Detecting and mitigating hallucination in videos generated by LLMs.~~

### Plan

- [x] Develop an API to search the web. Click to [try it out](https://atlasproject-phi.vercel.app/docs "Test the API").
- [x] Scrape the contents of the resulting links from the search.
- [x] Summarize the contents of the extracted text.
- [x] Identify the difference between the LLM's response and the results from our search.
- [x] Prompt the user of potential hallucinations if any are detected.
- [x] Mitigate by allowing the users to delve deeper and if they are satisfied, substitute the LLM's response with ours.
- [x] Create a site to test how atlas will detect hallucinations in LLMs.
- [x] Create browser extension to finally test how atlas will operate.

## Results And Analysis

During our tests or evaluations we use two of the most popular LLMs, OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com "ChatGPT") and
Google's [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com "Gemini").

- ChatGPT returned **120** accurate responses out of 200.
- Gemini returned **98** accurate responses out of 200.

- Both LLMs returned **82** responses that were hallucinations(even though they happened for different questions).

We noticed that _ChatGPT was more accurate than Gemini_ in most cases and Gemini was more prone to hallucinations.

ChatGPT seems to be trained on more data than Gemini and Gemini tried to avoid certain questions but ChatGPT answered all the questions
it could.

The following charts show the results mentioned above.

## Conclusion

We were able to create a tool that can detect hallucinations in LLMs.
Our tool successfully detects almost all the hallucinations in LLMs.
However, our tool is not perfect and can still be improved since not all information is on the internet and some are inaccurate or contain
biases.

## Future Works

Future works can use this [methodology](https://github.com/amarquaye/atlas-api "Our source code") and combine with other techniques to improve the accuracy of hallucinations detection.
